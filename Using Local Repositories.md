**Description :**

## **Clone a local repository** :
Say you have a repository under `/home/path/to/repo.git` and you want to clone it into the `project/` directory (it is created if it doesn't exist)
```powershell
git clone --local file:///home/path/to/repo.git project
```

Note that, if your project is in a directory (with a .git directory within), you can also use the directory name as the pointer to the repository:

$ git clone --local file:///path/to/repo/directory project
---
## ** ** :

```powershell

```
